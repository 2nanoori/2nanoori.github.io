## 1. Overview

Recently, while working on a software development project, I had the opportunity to think deeply about Exception Handling.

While integrating a third-party library, I encountered conflicts between the library's guidelines and our application's exception handling approach. This led me to reconsider exception handling practices, and I decided to revisit the concepts from Effective Java 3rd Edition - a true bible for Java developers.

As you can see from the table of contents, Exception Handling deserves an entire chapter rather than just a single item, highlighting its critical importance.

Let me explore Effective Java's exception handling principles and reflect on how to solve the real-world problems I've encountered.

## 2. Exception Handling Principles

The opening statement sets the tone perfectly:

> "Used properly, exceptions can improve a program's readability, reliability, and maintainability. Used improperly, they can have the opposite effect."

I completely agree with this statement, and I believe developers should always consider whether improper usage might occur.

### 2.1. Use Exceptions Only for Exceptional Conditions

Exceptions should be used only for **truly exceptional situations that disrupt the normal flow** of a program.

Using exceptions for situations that can be handled with simple conditional statements leads to **performance degradation**, **reduced readability**, and **debugging difficulties**.

**Why shouldn't exceptions be overused?**

1. **Performance Issues**
   - Throwing exceptions is relatively expensive
   - Frequent exceptions in loops can significantly impact performance

2. **Reduced Code Readability**
   - Too much exception handling code makes normal logic hard to read
   - Overused exceptions = "control flow via exceptions" → not intuitive

3. **Debugging Difficulties**
   - Unnecessary exceptions create longer stack traces, making actual problem identification harder

**Proper Usage Examples**

- **Situations for exception handling:**
  - Unpredictable errors: network disconnection, missing files, DB connection failures
  - External system dependency failures
  - Programming contract violations (IllegalArgumentException within reasonable bounds)

- **Situations to avoid exception handling:**
  - Simple conditional checks are sufficient
  - Normal situations that frequently occur in loops

```java
// Wrong: Using exceptions for existence checks in loops
for (String s : list) {
    try {
        process(s);
    } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
        // Simply because the list is empty
        // Conditional handling is much more efficient
    }
}

// Correct:
for (String s : list) {
    if (s != null) {
        process(s);
    }
}

// File reading where file doesn't exist -> exception appropriate
try {
    readFile("nonexistent.txt");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

### 2.2. Use Checked Exceptions for Recoverable Conditions and Runtime Exceptions for Programming Errors

Java provides three types of throwables: checked exceptions, runtime exceptions, and errors. Here's guidance on when to use each:

> **Recoverable conditions** → **Checked exceptions**
> **Programming errors** → **Runtime exceptions**

- **Checked Exceptions**
  - Force callers to handle exceptions
  - Use for situations where the program can recover

- **Unchecked Exceptions**
  - Subclasses of `RuntimeException`
  - Callers don't need to handle them
  - Represent programming errors that should be fixed through code changes

<div class="mermaid">

    A["Should throw an exception?"] --> B{"Normal flow?"}
    
    B -->|Yes| C["Use conditionals<br/>if / for etc."]
    B -->|No| D["Use exceptions"]
    
    D --> E{"Exception type selection"}

    E -->|Programming error| G["Runtime Exception<br/>Code fix required<br/>Example: IndexOutOfBounds, NullPointer"]
</div>

### 2.3. Avoid Unnecessary Checked Exceptions

**Checked exceptions** force callers to handle exceptions. However, if it's not truly a recoverable situation, using checked exceptions **hurts API usability and makes code messy**.

**Why is this problematic?**

1. **Messy caller code**
```java
try {     
    obj.action(); 
} catch (SomeCheckedException e) {     
    // Actually no recovery method available     
    throw new RuntimeException(e); 
}
```
→ Callers inevitably end up with unnecessary "catch and rethrow" code.

2. **Reduced API usability**
   - Developers always have to write try-catch blocks
   - APIs become unnecessarily complex

**Correct Design Principles**

- Use **runtime exceptions (Unchecked Exception)** instead of checked exceptions if no recovery is possible
- Use checked exceptions only when clients must respond
- **Optional / null returns** might be better in some cases

**Examples**

- Wrong approach
```java
// Caller cannot actually recover
public void connect() throws IOException {     
    // IOException thrown on connection failure
}
```

```java
try {
    service.connect();
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Cannot recover but must catch and rethrow or just log
}
```

- Improved approach
```java
// Not recoverable → change to runtime exception
public void connect() {
    if (/* failure */) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot connect to server");
    }
}
```

```java
// No recovery needed → provide state check method
if (service.canConnect()) {
    service.connect();
}
```

### 2.4. Favor the Use of Standard Exceptions

Java provides **well-defined standard exception classes**. Rather than defining new exception classes, using appropriate standard exceptions is advantageous for **consistency, readability, and maintainability**.

**Standard exceptions should be the first choice**, and creating new exceptions should be a last resort.

**Why use standard exceptions?**

1. **Consistency**
   - All Java developers can easily understand the meaning
   - Names like `NullPointerException`, `IllegalArgumentException` are self-explanatory

2. **Avoiding unnecessary duplication**
   - No need to create custom exceptions with the same functionality as existing ones

3. **API simplification**
   - Prevents unnecessary proliferation of exception classes → easier maintenance

**Commonly Used Standard Exceptions**

| Exception | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| **IllegalArgumentException** | When arguments are invalid |
| **IllegalStateException** | When object state is inappropriate for method call |
| **NullPointerException** | When null arguments are not allowed |
| **IndexOutOfBoundsException** | When index is out of range |
| **ConcurrentModificationException** | When concurrent modification is prohibited |
| **UnsupportedOperationException** | When called method is not supported |

**Examples**

- Using standard exceptions
```java
public void setAge(int age) {
    if (age < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be negative: " + age);
    }
    this.age = age;
}
```

- Unnecessary custom exception
```java
// Actually IllegalArgumentException is sufficient
public class InvalidAgeException extends RuntimeException {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

### 2.5. Throw Exceptions Appropriate to the Abstraction

Exceptions thrown by a method should **match the abstraction level** of that method. 

**Lower-level implementation details should not leak through exceptions** - they should be translated to exceptions appropriate for the higher abstraction level.

**Why is this important?**

1. **Maintaining Encapsulation**
   - External APIs shouldn't change when internal implementation technology changes
   - Exposing internal exceptions leaks implementation details

2. **Consistent API**
   - Callers only need to think at the method's abstraction level
   - "What situations can cause this method to fail?" is all they need to understand

3. **Maintenance ease**
   - If internal technology changes (e.g., DB → file storage), client code shouldn't need updates if API exceptions change

**Wrong Example (Exposing Implementation Exceptions)**
```java
// Internal library code
public List<String> readNames() throws SQLException {
    // DB access logic
}
```
- Problem: Clients depend on `SQLException` → API changes needed when DB is replaced

**Correct Example (Matching Abstraction Level)**
```java
// Abstracted API
public List<String> readNames() throws DataAccessException {
    try {
        // DB access
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new DataAccessException("Database read failed", e);
    }
}
```
- Clients only need to understand **"data cannot be read"** in abstract terms
- Internal implementation (DB vs file) can change without affecting the API

**Exception Translation**

- Convert lower-level exceptions → higher-level abstraction exceptions
- Methods:
  - **Exception Translation**: Wrap lower exceptions in higher-level exceptions
  - **Exception Chaining**: Pass lower exception as cause (`new MyException("msg", cause)`)

```java
try {
    // DB access
} catch (SQLException e) {
    throw new DataAccessException("Data access failed", e); // include cause
}
```

## 3. Conclusion: Applying Lessons to Real-World Problems

After studying the theory, let me share how I resolved the **library integration problem** mentioned in the overview.

### 3.1. Problem Situation: Two Conflicting Exception Handling Approaches

The third-party library we were integrating validates requests before they reach application controllers. The library guidelines were:

- The `checkPermission()` method throws a single `AuthorizationException` on failure
- This exception contains an `ErrorCode` indicating the failure reason (`TOKEN_EXPIRED`, `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS`)
- The `GlobalExceptionHandler` should catch this `AuthorizationException`, check the internal `ErrorCode`, and use `if/else` branching to return different HTTP status codes (401, 403, etc.)

**[Library-recommended approach]**
```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(AuthorizationException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleAuthorizationException(AuthorizationException e) {
        // 😫 Logic to analyze the cause inside ExceptionHandler
        if (e.getErrorCode() == ErrorCode.TOKEN_EXPIRED) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED)
                .body(new ErrorResponse("Token has expired."));
        } else if (e.getErrorCode() == ErrorCode.INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS) {
            return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN)
                .body(new ErrorResponse("Access denied."));
        }
        // ... various other error code branches
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
            .body(new ErrorResponse("Unknown authentication error."));
    }
}
```

However, this conflicted with our project's exception handling principles:

- `ExceptionHandler` should have **simple responsibility** - only converting exception types to appropriate HTTP responses
- Throw **clear custom exceptions matching the root cause** (e.g., `ProductNotFoundException`, `InvalidOrderException`)

### 3.2. Finding Solutions with Effective Java Principles

The Effective Java principles I just summarized provided clear direction:

- **Item 73: Throw exceptions appropriate to the abstraction**
  - The interceptor's role is the **abstract concept** of 'authentication/authorization'. Exposing `AuthorizationException` with **library implementation details** is inappropriate. `TOKEN_EXPIRED` should be translated to `UnauthorizedException`, and `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS` to `ForbiddenException` at a higher abstraction level.

- **Item 75: Exception Translation**
  - Instead of exposing lower-level exceptions directly, I decided to apply 'exception translation' by wrapping them in appropriate higher-level exceptions. The `Interceptor` would act as an 'adapter', catching the library's `AuthorizationException` and converting it to project-compliant exceptions.

### 3.3. Final Solution: Maintaining Architectural Consistency Through Exception Translation

**1. Define Project-Appropriate Custom Exceptions**

First, I defined exceptions appropriate for our project's abstraction level:

```java
// 401 Unauthorized
public class UnauthorizedException extends RuntimeException {
    public UnauthorizedException(String message) { super(message); }
}

// 403 Forbidden
public class ForbiddenException extends RuntimeException {
    public ForbiddenException(String message) { super(message); }
}
```

**2. Apply Exception Translation in Interceptor**

Then, I modified the `AuthInterceptor` to catch the library's exceptions and translate them to appropriate custom exceptions:

```java
@Component
public class AuthInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {

    private final AuthenticationService authService; // External library service

    // ... constructor omitted ...

    @Override
    public boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Object handler) {
        try {
            String token = request.getHeader("Authorization");
            authService.checkPermission(token); // This method throws AuthorizationException
        } catch (AuthorizationException e) {
            // ✨ Exception Translation happens here
            if (e.getErrorCode() == ErrorCode.TOKEN_EXPIRED) {
                throw new UnauthorizedException("Authentication token is invalid.");
            } else if (e.getErrorCode() == ErrorCode.INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS) {
                throw new ForbiddenException("You don't have permission to access this resource.");
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

**3. Simplified ExceptionHandler**

As a result, the `GlobalExceptionHandler` returned to its clean original role of 'simple conversion based on exception type':

```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    // 👍 Handler with clear roles and responsibilities
    @ExceptionHandler(UnauthorizedException.class)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED)
    public ErrorResponse handleUnauthorized(UnauthorizedException e) {
        log.info(e.getMessage());
        return new ErrorResponse(e.getMessage());
    }

    @ExceptionHandler(ForbiddenException.class)
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN)
    public ErrorResponse handleForbidden(ForbiddenException e) {
        log.warn(e.getMessage());
        return new ErrorResponse(e.getMessage());
    }
    
    // ... other handlers ...
}
```

## 4. Final Thoughts

While library and framework guidelines are important, when they conflict with our application's overall design principles and consistency, it may be better to integrate them non-intrusively by adding an 'adapter' layer as shown above.

Ultimately, good exception handling goes beyond simply catching errors - it's an important design activity that enhances code **readability, maintainability, and overall system stability**.
